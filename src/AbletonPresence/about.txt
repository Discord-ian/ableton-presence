Data collection is completely opt-in, and you will be asked only once.
This file serves to inform you more about the inner workings of AbletonPresence and it's data storage,
if you're into that kind of thing.
If you want to view the source code, head to the repository and into the src folder.

Some info about the files inside:
The file "main_config.json" contains info that tells Ableton Presence how to act.
The value "collect_data" determines whether or not to send data.
---->If it is set to "true", data will be sent to an external server. This data
     is only for analytical reasons.
     The data sent only includes your OS, and what version of Ableton Presence you are using.
If "collect_data" is set to false, nothing is sent.
"has_asked" indicates whether or not you have been asked if you would like to participate in analytics collection.
The "id" string is created only if "collect_data" is set to true.
It creates a random (although not password-like) code to identify your computer.
The only purpose this serves is for me to see how many installations of Ableton Presence there are.

The file "version.json" includes the version of this file, "about.txt".

At the time of writing (1.9.0), these are the only values contained within main_config.json.

This file will be automatically updated when new data needs to be added to it.
